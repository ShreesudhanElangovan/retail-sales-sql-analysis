## 1️⃣ Revenue Concentration

- A small subset of products contributes a disproportionately large share of total revenue.
- This follows the **Pareto principle (80/20 rule)** where top-performing products drive the majority of sales.

**Insight:** Revenue is highly dependent on a limited product portfolio.

## 2️⃣ High-Volume but Low-Profit Products

- Several products sell in high quantities but generate **below-average revenue and profit**.
- These products are often priced too low or heavily discounted.

**Insight:** High sales volume does not necessarily translate to profitability.

---

## 3️⃣ Discount Impact on Profitability

- Certain orders show **total discount amounts exceeding total profit**.
- Heavy discounting erodes margins and can lead to loss-making orders.

**Insight:** Discounts are negatively impacting profitability when not controlled.

- A small number of peak months account for a large portion of annual revenue.

**Insight:** Sales performance is seasonal and time-dependent.

## 6️⃣ Customer Attrition

- These lost customers represent potential revenue recovery opportunities.

**Insight:** Customer churn exists and should be actively monitored.

---

## 7️⃣ Order-Level Anomalies

- Some orders contain an unusually high number of items compared to the average order.
- These orders may indicate bulk purchases, promotions, or operational anomalies.
